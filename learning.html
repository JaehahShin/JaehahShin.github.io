Since starting university, I've been fascinated by the idea of learning efficiently. The sheer amount of material to cover drove me to experiment with different study methods to optimize my habits. I always prioritize understanding concepts rather than just mindlessly practicing questions, even when time is tight. I'm not saying that practicing questions isn't important, but fully grasping the concepts before tackling practice questions is crucial.
Through trial and error, I discovered my own learning technique by my third undergraduate year, which interestingly aligns with the Feynman Technique for learning:
Choose a concept to learn.
Teach it to yourself or someone else.
Return to source material if you get stuck.
Simplify your explanations and create analogies.
Now, below are my own learning strategies that happened to be similar enough with Feynman Technique. 
First, I always prepare papers so that I can start writing down what I've learned. 
Second, I write down concepts and course materials based on my understanding, referring to the notes I've compiled during lectures.
Third, if I get stuck or am unsure how to derive certain physics, math, or algorithms, I spend 5-10 minutes trying to fully understand them. If I still can't figure it out, I fold the corner of the paper to remind myself to revisit it later.
Fourth, after reviewing all the materials, I return to the folded pages to re-think and solve the challenging parts.
Fifth, with all the materials organized, I read through everything again, explaining it to myself. I pay extra attention to the folded papers since those were the areas I initially struggled with.
If individuals are able to understand things fully, then they have a strong foundation to apply those concepts in real life.
